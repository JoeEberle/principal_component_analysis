Hi Joe Eberle and I like Mihir have been working on applying articial intelligence and data science  to the health care for 30 plus years. I ma very excited about this team and approach because it takes a innovative behavioural science approach to actually support and empower the patients and assists care givers in a way to help avoid burnout.  


While we are chatting we are using AI and machine learning to augment their longitudinal record and known social determinates to stratify the patients care gaps and risks to establish cohorts. We use these cohorts of like patients so we can make recommend peronalized that have been effective for patients like them.
